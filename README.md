# Myo My

##Introduction
With the rise of of non-contact user interfaces and interactions, the use of gesture based UI has flourished. With this has come the advent of new issues, research and ideas into human interaction with machines and the validity with traditional “touch” based input. In this project we explored one of these new technologies, the Myo Armband, and have drawn conclusions as to whether or not the technology as it stands is a competent competitor to other input methods.

##Purpose of the Application
We set out to create a rhythm-based game using gesture controls alongside the beat of the music. We put a lot of consideration into the technology we needed to use for this task. Our first instinct was to use the Myo Armband to shake your wrist alongside the beat, but we had to consider first using perhaps a Microsoft Kinect. We settled on using the Myo Armband over the Microsoft Kinect, for reasons explained later on.
Initially, we wanted to create an experience somewhat similar to playing the drums, but throughout the development, we felt it was better to move on to something similar to the likes of Guitar Hero. This led us to create a tower defence style game where enemies are walking towards your base, and you must use the appropriate gesture to defeat the enemies.
This worked well for us as it allowed us to use more gestures with the Myo Armband, which in turn allowed us to utilize the Myo a lot more.
The music was recorded at 128BPM at first, however, this was later changed to 120 BPM track with a simplified beat. This ensured that enemy spawning would remain in in sync while the pitch and spawn intervals were altered by a number divisible by two.

##Gestures Used
The original game idea was creating a rhythm-based game, therefore the most appropriate gesture we wanted to incorporate was something similar to playing the drums. The Myo fits on the wrist as it is, so it was perfect for this gesture. We eventually decided to link the rhythm to the spawning of the enemies as opposed to linking it with the gestures performed by the user.
The game type changed as development went on, however, so we had to adapt the Myo to the new style of game. Luckily, each of the Myo’s gestures are unique, so it was perfect for the new game style. The Myo gestures or ‘poses’ we used for this application were - ‘Fingers Spread’, ‘Fist’, ‘Left Wave’ and ‘Double Tap’. We had the option of using a ‘Right Wave’ pose alongside these, but opted not to use it as it was too similar to the Left Wave pose. This meant that each of the poses for our game were unique and could not be easily confused with each other. The gestures can be found [here](https://support.getmyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/202647853-What-gestures-does-the-Myo-armband-recognize-). These unique individual gestures were the selling point in us using the Myo Armband over the Microsoft Kinect.

##Hardware Used in Creating the Application
There were multiple choices at first as to what technology we could use for the project. Out of which we have chosen the Myo armband by Thalmic Labs. The Myo armband is a relatively new device that is worn around the forearm that can read the user’s arm orientation by utilising the in-built gyroscope, and hand gestures by detecting the contracting muscles of the forearm. This allows the device to be able to distinctly read gestures among those mentioned above.
We have also chosen this hardware as multiple devices were available for use in class whereas hardware more limited in number would be harder to freely use as other students may utilise the same hardware in their projects developed in parallel with ours. The development kit itself is also highly portable, allowing for testing and development at home, which larger, less deployable hardware would not allow for.
Throughout the development of the project, the type of project we were creating changed. The Myo Armband had the clear advantage over the Kinect. We needed unique poses for this game, so the Myo was perfect for this task. Each Myo movement is different than the last and cannot be confused with each other, we felt this was better than the Kinect in the sense that the movement or ‘gestures’ were more rigid, and could be used well for the game.


##System Architecture


##Conclusion
In conclusion, we have found that, though the armband allows for unhindered movement and is generally quite responsive, it becomes tiring quickly when gestures are based around the movement of the entire arm, or specific areas of the hand and wrist. In contrast traditional input methods allow for longer sessions of use, however, they restrict the user’s movement.
